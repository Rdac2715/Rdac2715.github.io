        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Top 10 movies</h1>
        <p>After hours of rewatching my favorites from voer the years. Across every genre and culture of movie that I have watched from horror, comedy, action etc. has been assembled here. I am no professional but my goal was to put out some friendly suggetion
            for a friday movie night with friends of family. </p>
        <h4>Number 10: My Neighbor Totoro</h4>
        <img src="../images/totoro.jpg" alt="totoro movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>I have watched this movie easily half a dozen times by now as my sister always enjoyed it. In this colorful work of art that stands the test of time. You find yourself lost in this whimsical world. </p>
        <h4>Number 9: Skyfall</h4>
        <img src="../images/skyfall.jpg" alt="Skyfall movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>Out of every James Bond movie I have had the pleasure of watching. Skyfall was always my favorite, from the score and set designs this action-packed movie has something for everyone. </p>
        <h4>Number 8: Diehard</h4>
        <img src="../images/die-hard.jpg" alt="diehard movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>Die hard as many have called it "a brain-dead movie" is about as fun and intense as a Christmas movie can get... If you can ever consider it one. It was very violent but after watching you can appreciate just why so many people enjoyed it.</p>
        <h4>Number 7: Unbroken</h4>
        <img src="../images/unbroken.jpg" alt="unbroken movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>I am not going to lie, this movie was a tear jerker, from the bleak visuals and gut-wrenching story. You get lost in this powerful movie. I think any person can come to enjoy it, just bring a bag of popcorn and a box of tissues, "or any nearby
            pet for that matter"</p>
        <h4>Number 6: Alien</h4>
        <img src="../images/alien.jpg" alt="alien movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>Alien was officially the first horror movie I ever watched. I don’t remember it being too scary because of how world shattering the designs of the Alien are and the actors picked. I recommend it for any fans of classical horror.</p>
        <h4>Number 5: In This Corner of the World</h4>
        <img src="../images/Corner-of-world.png" alt="in this corner of the world movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>This movie was a hard one to revisit. This movie is just depressing because of its story. While one may see this as a negative I see the opposite as the best and most colorful moments of the movie leave even more of an impact when stood beside
            a movie of Japanese romance set during WWII</p>
        <h4>Number 4: The Dark Knight</h4>
        <img src="../images/batman.jpg" alt="the dark knight movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>I watched this movie not too long ago one winter's day and I immediately regretted not watching it sooner. Its dark story of cycles of hatred and villainy are a powerful message. That mixed with its score by Hans Zimmer make this the best Batman
            movie of all time. </p>
        <h4>Number 3: Into the Spider verse</h4>
        <img src="../images/spiderman.jpeg" alt="into the spider verse movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>This movie was breath taking every time I watched it. Its visuals and use of art styles found in comic books made this a trend setter and the single best animated movie of the year. </p>
        <h4>Number 2: The Dog that Stopped the War</h4>
        <img src="../images/dog.jpg" alt="the dog that stopped the war movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p> to any fans of a wholesome movie about love, loss and coming of age, this movie is for you. The characters are all wonderful and memorable whilst the inclusion of a dog as a main character makes the movie even more entertaining. Just a warning,
            the ending is a heart breaker. </p>
        <h4>Number 1: The Book of Life</h4>
        <img src="../images/book.jpg" alt="the book of life movie" width="300" height="500">
        <p>The book of life is my single favorite movie of all time. The direction of the art that tells such a deep story and adds depth to the animated world was trend setting for its time. Don’t even get me started on the music as that makes this movie
            easily an 11/10</p>
