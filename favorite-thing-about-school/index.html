    <h1>My Favorite Things About School</h1>
    <h6>By: Cooper Affleck</h6>

    <h3>Class</h3>
    <p>I have always like science as a subject so you can bet I like my chemsitry class just as much</p>

    <h3>Clubs</h3>
    <p>I currently am not a part of any club programs as I prefer to meet with teachers or just work by myself on classwork</p>

    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>I participate in after school rowing with the EPS rowing team.</p>
    <p>We have competed in several competitions and always do our best rain or shine.</p>
    <p>With how unlucky we have been with when the rainy and unpredictable condtions out on the water, I feel proud that the team is always in high spirits.</p>
