            <h2 class="center ">Overview</h2>
            <p> Although I am still quite rusty for not having touched Visual Studio code in 8 months, I still remember quite a bit and am confident I can get back to speed in no time. I can always use previous code as well since I wrote it myself, I don't
                know how much longer I can keep pulling from my past sites due to the quickly rising expectation for the sites we are making but regardless I know I can make it with a little bit of grit.

        <div class="grid-item main2 ">
            <h2 class="center ">Current Developments</h2>
            <p>Currently, wind turbines can be built and set-up on land and sea and have only become more available since the mid-1940's when they first came into use. The global wind power market has been growing rapidly since the 2010s and has been providing.
                stable jobs of further research as well as development. The need for a clean and easy sustainable energy source has been a point of discussion for several decades and wind power might just be the answer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item main3 ">
            <h2 class="center ">History</h2>
            <p>Wind energy has been harnessed for over a millennia in the form of sailboats and water pumps. Over the centuries, this art has become more precise and useful. Wind has always been used to harness natural resources, whether that be water pumps,
                grain and wood harvesting, and many other forms. Now-a-days the next natural resource is what would be collected, Energy! Wind power serves the same purpose as always, just on a much larger scale and will only continue to improve.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item support1 ">
            <h2 class="center ">Pros</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wind power has created 100,000+ jobs over the last century and that number continues to grow as nations have begun to see how useful wind energy can be to create energy.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Wind is a clean and reusable energy source and, as such, mankind will never need to worry about running out.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Wind turbines can be placed virtually anywhere, meaning the wind power business can continue to grow exponentially.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item support2 ">
            <h2 class="center ">Cons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wind turbines cause noise pollution which can disturb both people and local wildlife.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Flying animals have been known to occasionally fly into wind turbines, which is a danger to both the animal and the wind turbine.
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Many wind turbines need to be constructed far from cities and towns because of noise pollution which means more infrastructure is needed to move energy around and this makes them harder to repair in case of damages.
                </li>

                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Unfortunately wind turbines are also quite expensive to construct.
